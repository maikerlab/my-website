# Maik's Website

This is my personal Website, where I want to publish Blog Posts and tell something about myself and my work.
It was created with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Props

Here are the top resources I've used to learn about web development that I've benefited from the most:

- ["Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS" on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/)
- ["Easily create a blog with Next.js, MDX, SSG and Syntax Highlighting" on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_0SBJMxmcw)

## Development

Run the Development Server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deployment

The site is currently deployed on [malorama.vercel.app](https://malorama.vercel.app/).
